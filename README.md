# Segmenting car parts with Deloitte
Final Project of Deep Learning at DTU.

This repo will hold the notebooks and scripts to train a neural network - **NOT** the actual data. 

To be able to run the code, the following structure is expected locally:
```
.
├── notebooks
│   ├── holds all the Jupyter notebooks (as remote)
└── src
    ├── holds all python source files (as remote)
└── data
    ├── holds all data for training+testing
└── trained_models
    ├── holds models trained on the HPC
```
